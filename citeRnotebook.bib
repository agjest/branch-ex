  abstract = {Denne masterutredningen handler om børshandlede fond tilbudt av DNB og Handelsbanken. Ved hjelp av regresjonsanalyser og t-tester undersøker vi hvor godt fondene følger deres referanseindeks, som er OBX-indeksen. Vi tester også for hvilken fondstilbyder som følger referanseindeksen best. Videre ser vi på hvordan fondsmekanismene i girede børshandlede fond endres ved en «kjøp-og-hold»-strategi, og benytter Monte Carlo-simulering, en volatilitetsmodell og en rentemodell for å undersøke dette. 
Våre analyser tyder på at alle fondene historisk har gitt en lavere daglig avkastningsmultippel enn det som er kommunisert i fondsprospektene. Ved sammenligning av fondstilbydere kommer vi frem til at DNB sitt indeksfond og Handelsbankens Bear-fond kommer nærmest lovet avkastningsmultippel i deres kategori. Bull-fondene fra de to tilbyderne klarer vi ikke å skille. Ved undersøkelse av fondsmekanismer finner vi ut at ved høyere volatilitet, og lengre tidshorisont, vil fondsverdiene bli redusert over tid. Dette viser også en empirisk analyse vi gjennomførte på datasettet vårt.},

Furthermore, carbon emissions are also decomposed according to the Kaya identity with the aim to assess which are the main sources of inequality. The analysis shows that the principal source of inequality is represented by the differences in GDP, especially for the energy consumption; whereas carbon emissions evidence a stable level of inequality during the period of analysis.

  abstract = {In this paper we examine the intraday trading patterns of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the London Stock Exchange. ETFs have been shown to be characterised by much lower bid–ask spread costs and by lower levels of information asymmetry than individual securities. One possible explanation for intraday trading patterns is that concentration of trading arises at the start of the trading day because informed traders have private information that quickly diminishes in value as trading progresses. Since ETFs have lower trading costs and lower levels of information asymmetry we would expect these securities to display less pronounced intraday patterns than individual securities. We fail to find that ETFs are characterised by concentrated trading bouts during the day and therefore find support for the argument that information asymmetry is the cause of intraday volume patterns in stock markets. We find that ETF bid–ask spreads and volatility are elevated at the open but not at the close. This lends support to the “accumulation of information” explanation that sees high spreads and volatility at the open as a consequence of information accumulating during a market closure and impacting on the market when it next opens.},

We then present series of short term dynamics of poverty, decomposing the changes in every period of time with panel data. Finally, we analyse the determinants of poverty, with a focus on accounting for observed differences in income (and thereby poverty) between October 2001 and May 2002. Among other conclusions, we find in our decomposition analysis that households without the means to diversify their income sources suffered more than others from the crisis of 2002.},

Using data from the Ministero dell'Economia e Finanza (MEF), we construct measures of income inequality for each province (Gini index and Theil index). The stock of infrastructures by province is measured by a set of indicators of physical endowments built by the Istituto Tagliacarne. The empirical analysis confirms the existence of a negative effect of the total infrastructure endowment on income inequality. This effect is mainly driven by transport and energy infrastructures. In contrast, other sub-components of infrastructure endowment, such as technological and banking infrastructures as well as cultural/entertainment networks, accentuate income inequality. We then show that infrastructures have a positive effect on the incomes of both the relatively poor classes (20\% poorest class), the median and the richest class (10\% richest), while they have no effect on the poorest 10\% of the population. Finally, a north/south analysis of Italy suggests that the infrastructure deficit of the southern provinces might play a role in explaining their higher income inequality compared to the northern provinces.},

The major theorem establishes the converse: the decomposability property defines the Theil measure uniquely (up to a positive multiple) among all Lorenz-consistent measures.},

Properties of other school segregation indices are also discussed. In an empirical application, we document a weakening of the effect of ethnicity on school assignment from 1987/1988 to 2007/2008. We also show that segregation between districts within cities currently accounts for 33\% of total segregation. Segregation between states, driven mainly by the distinct residential patterns of Hispanics, contributes another 32\%.},

This gem of a book will be the ETF bible for years to come."  -Burton Malkiel, Chemical Bank Chairman's Professor of Economics, Princeton University  "This is the first comprehensive book on exchange-traded funds.The author displays an institutional and practical knowledge of exchange-traded funds that makes this book necessary reading for not only the knowledgeable investor but for the professional researcher seeking to understand these relatively new investment vehicles."  -Martin J. Gruber, Nomura Professor of Finance Stern School of Business, New York University  "Gary Gastineau is a national treasure. Exchange-traded funds are the wave of the future, and Gary has been instrumental in their development from day one. His knowledge is encyclopedic, and his style and subtle humor make it all accessible to the reader."  -Wayne H. Wagner, Chairman, Plexus Group, Inc.  "In Gary Gastineau's brilliant work in illuminating the reader on exchange-traded funds, he provides rich insights into the process and methodology of adding value and cites a convergence of market forces that creates a compelling story for the use of ETFs for those who choose to add value."  -Stephen C. Winks, Publisher, Senior Consultant  "The introduction of exchange-traded funds was one of the success stories of  Wall Street in the 1990s. Gary Gastineau was a key contributor to this success, and his book is an important benchmark on both the current status of this important new category and the vast potential of its next-generation products."  -Salvatore Sodano, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer American Stock Exchange},

This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future, and they can present the document’s contents in a different medium, e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or “source” document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences.},

  abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document.},

A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

It is found that the results are highly divergent, but that more results point towards ‘jobs following people’ than towards ‘people following jobs’. When it comes to the reasons for the variation in results, we find that the results are mostly shaped by the geographical location, spatial resolution, and population and employment characteristics present in the data, as well as by the model’s specification, its functional form and the spatial weight matrix specification.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that two entropy-based segregation indices possess an appealing mixture of basic and subsidiary but useful properties. It would appear that the only fundamental difference between the mutual information, or M index, and the Entropy, Information or H index, is that the second is a normalized version of the first. This paper introduces another normalized index in that famiy, the H* index that, contrary to what is often asserted in the literature, is the normalized entropy index that captures the notion of segregation as departures from evenness. More importantly, the paper shows that applied researchers may do better using the M index than using either H or H* in two dircunstances: (i) if they are interested in the decomposability of segregation measures for any partition of organizational units into larger clusters and of demographic groups into supergroups, and (ii) if they are interested in the invariance properties of segregation measures to changes in the marginal distributions by demographic groups and by organizational units},

During the analysis, several test distributions of populations and incomes are compared with a ‘reference’ distribution, characterized by an even distribution of population across regional subdivisions. Random permutation tests are also run to determine whether inequality measures commonly used in regional analysis produce meaningful estimates when applied to regions of different population size. The results show that only the population weighted coefficient of variation (Williamson’s index) and population-weighted Gini coefficient may be considered sufficiently reliable inequality measures, when applied to countries with a small number of regions and with varying population sizes.},
